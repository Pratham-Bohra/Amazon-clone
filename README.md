# Amazon-clone
This project is a simple clone of the Amazon website interface, featuring a responsive navbar with search, cart, and user sign-in options. It includes product category sections, a hero banner, and a footer with informational links. Styling is done using CSS, and Font Awesome icons are used for visual elements.
